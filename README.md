#### Identification of hot leads for a customer conversion centric organisation to maximize conversion rates

####What are leads?

Leads are potential customers whose information is collected by the organisation

####What is conversion rate?
Rate of leads which actually turn in and become the customer(by the product)

Initial Conversion rate - 38% (no modelling)

Final Conversion rate (after modelling) - 90% (accuracy)

####Steps in Modelling :

1) Simple Classification modelling using Logistic Regression

2) Recursive modelling using preprocessing tools and statsmodel

####Parameters involved in model optimization :

1) p value

2) variance inflation factor

####Model parameters to optimize :

1) Accuracy

2) Specificity

3) Sensitivity

4) ROC Curve area maximization
